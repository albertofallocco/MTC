This is my Master's Thesis final project.

Basically, it consists in a full evaluation and testing cycle of MTC, a novel machine learning paradigm for classification developed by my Supervisor. 
The repo contains the algorithm's code, as well as the code for the evaluation and testing batteries. 

Most likely, the code will be updated in the next months.
